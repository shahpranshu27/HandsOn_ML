However, having a **basic understanding** of these topics will make your learning process smoother.\n",

        "In simple terms, a **cost function** is just a **measure of how well our model is performing**. In machine learning, our goal is to **train a model** that makes predictions as **accurate as possible**. A **cost function** tells us how **\"off\"** our model's predictions are from the actual values.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Think of it like hiking down a hill**: If you want to get to the lowest point (minimizing the cost function), you need to figure out which direction to move in. **Gradient descent** helps us find the path to the \"bottom\" by adjusting the parameters step by step in the **direction** that reduces the cost function the most.\n",

        "In many ML algorithms, especially when dealing with **high-dimensional data** or **complex models** (e.g., deep learning), it’s impossible to **solve** the parameters analytically (like in linear regression’s normal equation).
